    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>There is a structure type defined as below:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="k">typedef</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">__map_t</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">code</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">NAME_SIZE</span><span class="p">];</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">alias</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span><span class="n">map_t</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If we want to assign <code>map_t</code> type variable <code>struct2</code> to <code>sturct1</code>, we usually have below 3 ways:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>

<p>Consider above ways, most of programmer won&#8217;t use way #1, since it&#8217;s so stupid ways compare to other twos, only if we are defining an structure assignment function. So, <strong><em>what&#8217;s the difference between way #2 and way #3? And what&#8217;s the pitfall of the structure assignment once there is array or pointer member existed?</em></strong> Coming sections maybe helpful for your understanding.</p>

<h2>The difference between <strong><em>&#8217;=&#8217; straight assignment</em></strong> and <strong><em>memcpy</em></strong></h2>

<p>The <code>struct1=struct2;</code> notation is not only <strong>more concise</strong>, but also <strong>shorter</strong> and <strong>leaves more optimization opportunities to the compiler</strong>. The semantic meaning of = is an assignment, while <code>memcpy</code> just copies memory. That&#8217;s a huge <strong>difference in readability</strong> as well, although <code>memcpy</code> does the same in this case.</p>

<p>Copying by straight assignment is probably best, since it&#8217;s shorter, easier to read, and has a higher level of abstraction. Instead of saying (to the human reader of the code) &#8220;copy these bits from here to there&#8221;, and requiring the reader to think about the size argument to the copy, you&#8217;re just doing a straight assignment (&#8220;copy this value from here to here&#8221;). There can be no hesitation about whether or not the size is correct.</p>

<p>Consider that, above source code also has pitfall about the pointer alias, it will lead dangling pointer problem (<em>It will be introduced below section</em>). If we use straight structure assignment &#8216;=&#8217; in C++, we <strong>can consider to overload the <code>operator=</code> function</strong>, that can dissolve the problem, and the structure assignment usage does not need to do any changes, but structure memcpy does not have such opportunity.</p>

<h2>The pitfall of structure assignment:</h2>

<p>Beware though, that copying structs that contain pointers to heap-allocated memory can be a bit dangerous, since by doing so you&#8217;re aliasing the pointer, and typically making it ambiguous who owns the pointer after the copying operation.</p>

<p>If the structures are of compatible types, yes, you can, with something like:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="n">memcpy</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dest_struct</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">source_struct</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">sizeof</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dest_struct</span><span class="p">));</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>}
The only thing you need to be aware of is that this is a shallow copy. In other words, if you have a <code>char *</code> pointing to a specific string, both structures will point to the same string.</p>

<p>And changing the contents of one of those string fields (the data that the <code>char <em></code> points to, not the <code>char </em></code> itself) will change the other as well. For these situations a &#8220;deep copy&#8221; is really the only choice, and that needs to go in a function. If you want a easy copy without having to manually do each field but with the added bonus of non-shallow string copies, use strdup:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="n">memcpy</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dest_struct</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">source_struct</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">sizeof</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dest_struct</span><span class="p">));</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">dest_struct</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">strptr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">strdup</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">source_struct</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">strptr</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will copy the entire contents of the structure, then deep-copy the string, effectively giving a separate string to each structure. And, if your C implementation doesn&#8217;t have a strdup (it&#8217;s not part of the ISO standard), you have to allocate new memory for <code>dest_struct</code> pointer member, and copy the data to memory address.</p>

<p>Below diagram illustrates above source memory layout, if there is a pointer field member, either the straight assignment or <code>memcpy</code>, that will be alias of pointer to point same address. For example, <code>b.alias</code> and <code>c.alias</code> both points to address of <code>a.alias</code>. Once one of them free the pointed address, it will cause another pointer as dangling pointer. <strong>It&#8217;s dangerous!!</strong></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<ul>
<li>Recommend use straight assignment &#8216;=&#8217; instead of memcpy.</li>
<li>If structure has pointer or array member, please consider the pointer alias problem, it will lead dangling pointer once incorrect use. Better way is implement structure assignment function in C, and overload the operator= function in C++.</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2013-01-14T21:47:00+04:00</updated>
    <id>http://utjhub.github.com/octo/blog/2013/01/14/retrospective-of-my-2012</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In our organization, we have a basic rule is: If you make retrospective for one specific sprint, you shall finish it in the sprint time slot. So it against our rule since I make 2012 retrospective in 2013, but later than never. I believe retrospective since I have ran agile for several years, I know it can benefit me.</p>

<p>My grandpa told my mother, and my mother told me that you have to look back and reflect on your life every night before you go to bed. It’s difficult for me, because I always tell story to my kid during that time, or do others, you know that&#8230; So I demand me shall make retrospective at least once annually.</p>

<h2>How have things gone?</h2>

<p>2012, some small changes in my job. I resigned my R&amp;D manager job, and selected R&amp;D coach job. Make this decision, it was based on my interesting, and strength(I think so). Some other reason is that I like to try some new rather than maintain old, I’d like do some challenge works.  Be a R&amp;D manager, I would think I’m somebody’s boss, only feel good, but it’s shit, since this manager title sometimes it will blind your eyes. To be honest, had such title, it just gratify my vanity after your handle it for years. After I had known what R&amp;D manager does, how to be a R&amp;D manager, and understand the real politic rule, I decide to quit,</p>

<p>I selected be a technical person rather than politician in such R&amp;D company. From this point, I think I kept a clear head, but somethings I have to recognize is that I learn a lot from this management position.</p>

<p>Later,  in May, June, my team and I held a clean code contest successfully, it got the supports from the heads, so it taught me that you have to align your idea with your boss, that you will make thing simple. And coming month, I sold my codemetrics idea,  delivered some training  and in the end of 2012, held the coderetreat global day of 2012 in Hangzhou City. Made such lots of actives in company internally, so the influence just only limited in our company, that’s a problem, personally think this shall be improved in 2013.</p>

<p>Another interesting works is have a taste on the translation works, in 2012, finish the  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Codermetrics-Analytics-Improving-Software-Teams/dp/1449305156" title=" &quot;Codermetrics">Codermetrics: Analytics for Improving Software Teams</a> to Chinese version translation. And finish personal owned embedded device development</p>

<h2>What improvements are needed</h2>

<p>Be fat, shall make a plan to resolve this problem. I shall learn some web technical in this web era, and be more active in open communities, learn more, and also shall seriously consider where I go. Maybe leave this country is a choice, even it’s not easy for a married man, so practice English communication skill is more important than before. I’ll continually post English blog here, translate English post to Chinese, and practice more.</p>
